# Document Conversion scripts for meeting minutes

## Installation
	`pip -r requirements.txt`
### Notes
	Should read write files to a temporary directory rather than main or pass filestream through. Look to expanding keyword dictionary and perhaps comparing document score against keywords rather than looking for occurance.
