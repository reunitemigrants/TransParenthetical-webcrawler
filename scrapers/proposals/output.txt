Assessor Rick Haberman and Treasurer Tevian Ekren-Kober were present. 
 
Haberman  explained  that  his  office  had  entered  an  incorrect  year  for  a  homeowner’s 
exemption to apply and requested a cancellation of taxes. 
 

(cid:1)  A  Motion  was  made  by  Commissioner  Morley  to  recommend  cancelling  taxes  for 
Antonio  and  Vitalia  Avila,  based  on  $59,790  of  assessed  value,  which  represents  the  value  of 
the homeowner exemption if it had been applied. It was seconded and carried with unanimous 
ayes. 
 
BRENT CULBERTSON—MAINTENANCE REPORT 
Maintenance Supervisor Brent Culbertson and Clerk/Auditor/Recorder Michelle Emerson were 
present. 
 
Maintenance:  Culbertson 
informed  the  Commissioners  of  remodeling  progress  at  the 
Courthouse  and  the  Airport.  He  had  also  made  repairs  at  the  jail,  and  he  presented  bids  for 
asphalt at all three County buildings. 
 
Emerson  advised  there  were  funds  remaining  in  the  current  budget  to  complete  the  above-
mentioned  projects.  She  suggested  obtaining  two  separate  heating  and  cooling  bids  for  both 
one room and two at the Annex. 
 

(cid:1)  A  Motion  was  made  by  Commissioner  Howell  to  approve  the  asphalt  repair  and 
sealcoating  at  the  Annex,  Courthouse,  and  Ambulance  Building.  It  was  seconded  and  carried 
with unanimous ayes. 
 
The  Commissioners  discussed  allowing  two-way  traffic  in  the  Courthouse  parking  lot  and 
restriping for straight parking. 
 
Comp  and  Vacation  Time:  The  Board  conversed  with  Culbertson  about  his  excessive 
accumulation of vacation and comp time. He said he would be taking a few personal days but 
that he did not object to being paid for his extra hours worked. 
 
KANSAS GUTHRIE—HUMAN RESOURCES REPORT 
Human Resources Director Kansas Guthrie was present. 
 
Guthrie reported she and the Employee Manual Committee were still updating the Manual to 
present  a draft to  the  Commissioners.  She  said the new  emergency  management  coordinator 
had attended training in preparation of the August 21 solar eclipse to be visible in Idaho.

  The Board asked Guthrie to consult the payroll clerk about possible insurance benefits 

from enrollment in the Wellness Program. 
 
The Board discussed voluntary medical forms with Guthrie; the matter had also been scheduled 
to discuss with legal counsel that afternoon. 
 
NANCY MARSHALL—PLANNING AND ZONING REPORT 
Planning  and  Zoning  Assistant  Administrator  Nancy  Marshall,  Code  Enforcer  Shawn  Denham, 
Mapper Mark Reyes, and Clerk/Auditor/Recorder Michelle Emerson were present. 
 
Marshall  gave  statistics  from  the  Planning  and  Zoning  Office  monthly  written  report.  She  told 
the Board that a computer glitch had expired all of the permits in her office and that Computer 
Arts  did  not  know  why.  She  said  employees  were  reticent  to  enter  more  permits  until  they 
knew how the glitch had occurred. 
 
Denham  read  from  his  code  enforcement  report  and  answered questions  from  Commissioner 
Roemer. 
 
Marshall  and  Denham  expressed  concerns  about  violations  of  irrigation  water  on  roadways. 
They said the P&Z office would like to help the road districts maintain the integrity of roads as 
well as to mitigate inconvenience to citizens but that violators receive no consequences. 
 
Denham explained that he sends two warning letters; he said the third violation would result in 
a  citation  for  an  infraction,  but  a  law  enforcement  officer  would  need  to  issue  the  citation. 
Marshall  said  a  deputy  used  to  accompany  the  former  code  enforcer  but  that  he  retired  and 
had not been replaced. 
 
Marshall  believed  that  ineffective  enforcement  is  worse  than  no  enforcement.  She  said 
complainants are angry because they do not see results from their complaints. 
 

  It was determined the Board would discuss water violations with both its legal counsel 

and the sheriff’s office later in the day. 
 
Marshall gave an overview of the activities of the new mapping department. She then told the 
Commissioners  the  Jerome  Cemetery  District  had  asked  the  County  mapper  to  create  a  map 
labeling all the plots in the cemetery. The Board determined that the District would need to pay 
for the mapping service. 
 
Denham was excused. 
 
Marshall said providing mapping services would be valuable to the citizenry.

MANDY HARPER—SIGN HARP-SHEP SUBDIVISION FINAL PLAT 
Planning  and  Zoning  Assistant  Administrator  Nancy  Marshall  was  present.  Also  present  were 
Mandy  Harper,  Stephen  Cook,  Robert  Capps,  Samuel  Gomez,  Mike  Hadlock,  Kevin  Boer,  and 
Sheila Capps, all residents of the Lazy T Subdivision. 
 
Marshall  explained  that  a  new  final  plat,  with  a  new  subdivision  name,  was  required  to 
accomplish a lot line adjustment in a platted subdivision. 
 
Robert  Capps,  as  acting  president  of  the  homeowners  association,  expressed  concerns  about 
preventing  subsequent  subdivisions  and  preserving  the  existence  of  the  association. 
Commissioner  Howell  and  Marshall  advised  him  to  seek  legal  counsel.  Marshall  said  that  the 
subdivision restrictions could be amended and that replatting the subdivision would assure that 
the lot lines were specific. 
 

(cid:1)  A  Motion  was  made  by  Commissioner  Howell  to  approve  the  Harp-Shep  Subdivision 

Final Plat as presented. It was seconded and carried with unanimous ayes. 
 
GEORGE OPPEDYK AND MARISELA IBARRA—DENTAL CONTRACT 
Deputy Sheriffs George Oppedyk and Marisela Ibarra were present. 
 
Ibarra  told  the  Board  Dr.  David  Wilkes  had  offered  a  contract  to  come  to  the  jail  to  provide 
dental services. 
 
Sheriff Doug McFall was present. 
 
Ibarra said there was money in the budget to cover the costs of additional equipment needed 
for  the  doctor.  She  added  that  the  contract  would  enhance  security  because  deputies  would 
not need to provide dental services by transporting inmates outside the County’s secure facility. 
 

(cid:1)  A Motion was made by Commissioner Howell to approve the contract agreement with 
Dr. David Wilkes upon approval by legal counsel. It was seconded and carried with unanimous 
ayes. 
 

  Ibarra said she would present the contract to legal counsel for review.

McCoy addressed the Board with the PDC’s concerns regarding its denial of a grant application 
for public defender funding and said the County could submit a revised application by July 21. 
The Commission’s concerns were the amount of 2017 grant funds not expended and a plan for 
using any FY 2018 grant funds the County would receive.

ascertain their needs before resubmitting the 2018 grant application.

Mike Seib were present. Also present were Carly Yager Johansen, Ryan Yager, and Gene Brown. 
 
Ekren-Kober  read  the  steps  her  office  had  taken  since  January  13,  2017,  because  of  property 
taxes owed by Carly Johansen that were overdue by three years and in jeopardy of the County 
filing  for  a  tax  deed.  She  said  Johansen  could  redeem  the  property  before  the  County  would 
auction it but that she would have to pay all back taxes to do so. 
 
Seib advised the Board could recess the hearing in order to allow Johansen time to pay overdue 
taxes. 
 
Yager said he could make payments every two weeks in order to pay for 2013 taxes. 
 

  The Board determined to continue the hearing until August 28 at 1:30 P.M. before making

FY  2016-17.  He  said  the  Post  had  sent  four  youth  to  Girls  State,  upgraded  the  meetinghouse 
lighting system, and refinished its floor. 
 
Brown said the Legion would appreciate any contribution from the County for FY 2017-18. He 
said  Legion  members  were  planning  to  change  light  fixtures,  refurbish  the  front  of  their 
building,  and  add  a  24-hour-a-day  lighted flag.  He  added  that  plans  also  included  beginning  a 
Sons of the American Legion Squad.

INDIGENT MATTERS—SUBORDINATION REQUEST FOR CASE NO. 0809-082 
Social  Services  Director  Kim  Burlington,  Payroll  Clerk  Lorrann  Morrell,  Human  Resources 
Director Kansas Guthrie, and Deputy Sheriff George Oppedyk were present. Also present were 
Linda Blamires (seeking a lien subordination) and her niece Ellen Driesel. 
 
Burlington advised that a lien subordination agreement would not affect the County’s lien for 
payment of medical services. 
 

(cid:1)  A Motion was made by  Commissioner Howell to sign the subordination agreement for 

Linda Blamires. It was seconded and carried with unanimous ayes. 
 

  Signing indigent decisions was continued until later in the day. 

 
MIKE SEIB—LEGAL COUNSEL 
Attorney Mike  Seib, Deputy  Sheriff  George  Oppedyk,  Code  Enforcer  Shawn  Denham,  Planning 
and Zoning Assistant Administrator Nancy Marshall, Clerk/Auditor/Recorder Michelle Emerson, 
Deputy Clerk Lorrann Morrell, and Human Resources Director Kansas Guthrie were present. 
 
Water on the Road: Code Enforcer Shawn Denham and Deputy Sheriff George Oppedyk were 
present.  The  Board  continued  its  deliberations  from  the  morning  about  enforcing  irrigation 
water violations. 
 
Deputy  Oppedyk  said  it  was  his  understanding  that  the  code  enforcer  would  investigate  a 
complaint and then call the sheriff’s office. 
 
Seib said the code enforcer could sign a citation and then a deputy sheriff would have to serve 
it. He suggested that complainants receive copies of warning letters sent to violators. 
 

  It was determined the code enforcer would give violations to the sheriff’s office, rather 

than to the prosecutor. 
 
It  was  decided  that  weekend  violations  could  be  signed  by  either  a  sheriff  deputy  or  a 
complainant, with any necessary investigation followed through by the code enforcer the next 
week. Deputy Oppedyk said he would tell the other officers the procedure. 
 

  Marshall and Denham were to write a protocol for dealing with violations to submit to 

the Commissioners. 
 
Voluntary  Medical  Forms  for  Employees:  Clerk/Auditor/Recorder  Michelle  Emerson,  Payroll 
Clerk Lorrann Morrell, and Human Resources Director Kansas Guthrie were present. 
 
Seib  said  he  had  approved  employees  at  the  Judicial  Annex  Building  voluntarily  submitting 
medical  information  to  be  accessed  in  case  of  an  emergency.  He  said  the  details  of  where  to 

 

Monday, July 10, 2017 

Page 8 of 9 

store  the  information  and  who  could  access  it  would  need  to  be  determined  for  Courthouse 
employees. 
 
Indigent Contract: Seib reported he was modifying a contract for mental holds, and the matter 
was continued until July 17. 
 
Mapping  for  the  Cemetery  District  (continued  from  the  morning):  Seib  advised  the  County 
could lend its equipment to another government agency and that the Cemetery District could 
possibly pay the County mapper directly for mapping services. 
 
APPROVE CLAIMS 
This matter was continued until July 11. 
 
READ AND APPROVE MINUTES 
Approving the minutes was continued until July 11.
